There is a special HBase Catalog table called the META table, which holds the location of the regions in the cluster. ZooKeeper stores the location of the META table.

This is what happens the first time a client reads or writes to HBase:

1. The client gets the Region server that hosts the META table from ZooKeeper.
2. The client will query the .META. server to get the region server corresponding to the row key it wants to access. The client caches this information along with the META table location.
3. It will get the Row from the corresponding Region Server.

For future reads, the client uses the cache to retrieve the META location and previously read row keys. Over time, it does not need to query the META table, unless there is a miss because a region has moved; then it will re-query and update the cache.
